# Sync Attempt Log — 2025-10-05

## Context
- Operator: root @ 977fcbff9e0b
- Repo scope: repos.yml (static)
- Branch context: work
- Git: git version 2.43.0 | rsync: rsync  version 3.2.7  protocol version 31 | gh: n/a
- Network: Restricted egress — outbound HTTP(S) requests to apt/github return 403
- Proxy configured: none detected

## Steps
1. Prereq check: failed — notes: `just doctor` unavailable (just missing) and `scripts/wgx doctor` exits with `Fehlt: yq`; dependency installation blocked by 403
2. Fleet listing: blocked — repos: n/a (requires `yq` to parse repos.yml)
3. Template validation: not run — missing: yq / gh CLI
4. Sync: mode=not started — result: blocked (exit=dependency-missing)

## Blockers
- `yq` (mikefarah) binary not available and cannot be downloaded due to 403 restrictions; GH CLI (`gh`) also absent

## Next Actions
- Re-run in environment with `just`, `yq` v4, and `gh` available (or installable) to allow WGX workflows to execute

## Re-Run — 2025-10-05 (Tool Bootstrap Attempt)
- commit: c2fdc26
- duration: n/a (blocked before sync)
- exit_code: 127 (docker)
- Tool container: `docker run ghcr.io/codex-bundles/wgx-fleet:stable` → `command not found: docker`
- Host tools: yq: missing | gh: missing | just: missing
- DRYRUN: not executed — `./scripts/wgx doctor` exits with `Fehlt: yq`
- Real sync: not executed — `./scripts/wgx up` exits with `Fehlt: yq`
- CI trigger: not executed — `./scripts/wgx run ci` exits with `Fehlt: yq`
- Notes: Environment lacks Docker runtime and outbound HTTPS to fetch binaries; cannot provision yq/gh/just offline.
- Next action: Retry from workstation/devcontainer that has Docker (or pre-baked toolchain) and unrestricted access to required binaries.
